# Cloud lesson 

## Learning objective
- Difference between PaaS, SaaS, and IaaS
- Explain benefits of cloud computing

### What is cloud computing?

- Refers to on-demand computing resources delivered via the internet
    - A cloud is a series of computers that exists in a data center
    - Said computers are strung together to create a service, including storage, processing power, web hosting, and more
    - Resources are pooled over virtual infrastructure
    - This offers power and flexibility of many devices coordinating at once

- In the end, you're on someone else's servers ~ infrastructure has been taken care of

### Benefits

- High availability
- Scalability
- Elasticity
- Agility
- Fault tolerence
- Disaster recovery


### Capital Expenditures: Scalability Dilemma

- Fixed capital expenditures (CapEx), such as physical infrastructure, scaling for growth can involve difficult choices that can often turn out wrong. 
    - You pay for something you don't need - growth doesn't happen
    - Physical servers are additional costs


### Scalability in the cloud

- Cloud services allow you to scale immediately with no service disruption
    - Pay for what you need, when you need it, and no guessing on additional investments

- Operational expenditure (OpEx) is safer than having to bet on a new piee of equipment

### Elasticity

- Your infrastructure has the ability to adapt to the a changing environment
    - Cloud computing can be quickly activated and deactivated in a precise and responsive mannger

### Agility

- As part of agile methodology, dev teams are looking to quickly deliver new and improved features to users. Must constantly iterate
- Cloud sets up the infrastructure for teams to do this, and, provides vital response data

### Activate cloud in case of emergency

- Fault tolerence: Ability for a system to continue operating despite problems and failtures along the way
- Less risk in case of a complete disaster

## Infrasture-as-a-service IaaS

- Lowest level of cloud computing.
- You rent IT infrasture ~ physical or virtual machines ~ from a cloud provider
- While you manage the application from the OS set-up, the cloud provide is managing the resources below it, i.e., hardware, data centers, and storage


## Platform-as-a-service PaaS

- Allows developers access to development platform on which they can quickly and easily deploy their application
- Operates a layer above the instrastructure and provides a means of developing, running, and managing the application
- This gives developers freedom to concentrate on building the software while not worrying about the OS, system updates, storage, or infrastructure

## Software-as-a-service SaaS

- CRM, email management, video conferencing ~ tools to help you get the job done, that you pay for, and maintaining them yourself would be inefficient
